Born n raised in a small village in Brazil's countryside (Apareceida do Leste - Mato Grosso), I've been since child an odd and curious soul. Growing up in such small and limited environment has given to me the perception that there is always something more to explore and expand my own boundaries. When teenager I moved to a relatively big city (not big to the world, but giant to me), there I lived just with my older brother to attend to highschool. Even far from my parents and home, it was a good decision and made me able to study on a high standart instituition. At the moment i am finishing my degree in Computer Science, in the state's capital and further from home. The future may lead me to a greater place, or back home.
