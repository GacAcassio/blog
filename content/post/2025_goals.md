Among all popular Western rituals, setting New Year's goals is certainly one of my favorites and most pleasant. As my imagination is a very active part of me, and projections of how the future may be are a hobby of mine, going through the process of writing down some targets sparks my soul, charging me with genuine energy. Hence, I’ve set a few targets for 2025, considering my experience from the past year and the context ahead of me. It may be a year of major changes: I’m graduating and starting my professional life, with some past questions regarding my path, such as returning to medical school or entering a master’s program. I might move to another city, and I could even try new things abroad. The possibilities are infinite, even if reduced to my reality. It could be easier to understand all of my expectations and challenges as we dive into my goal list for the year.

As I push myself into writing this in a foreign language, let's start with my purposes for learning languages. I aim to maintain a continuous Duolingo streak (currently using it to practice Spanish, Mandarin, and English), complete a C1 English course from the British Council, reach C1 level in Spanish, and learn basic Mandarin. Although technology is leading us into a world where real-time translation will become a widely spread and efficient tool, I still enjoy the experience of learning new languages and interacting with their speakers.

In honor of the book-loving child I once was, I plan to dedicate a fair amount of time to reading and writing, hoping this will be an opportunity to grow and keep a sharp mind. For the entire year, I expect to read about 25 books. Although I don't have a strict reading list, I do have some guidelines. These include prioritizing technical books, classic literature, and books focused on self-knowledge. Additionally, for writing activities, I have this blog, using Obsidian to track my studies, and my cherished diary. The goal is to keep these practices as regular as possible.

Moreover, mindfulness and yoga will complement this set of objectives for mental well-being. I’m challenging myself to implement these practices weekly to achieve a more balanced version of myself. While I’ve tried both for several years, I’ve never truly implemented them or learned from them.

In the field of physical health, I aim to become athletic for the first time in my life—not for appearance’s sake, but for long-term health and self-satisfaction. I started this journey last year, and running has been a great discovery for me. However, I can't say the same for the gym—I struggle with maintaining a consistent attendance. So, for this year, my intentions are to go to the gym 200 times, run 1000 km throughout the year, reduce my body fat to under 15%, and increase my muscle mass to over 40%.

To form a triangle with mindfulness and exercise, maintaining a healthy diet is a must on my new journey. I hope not only to eat healthily but also to learn about food—its chemistry, biology, and cultural significance. I also have some bad habits to eliminate. As for eating, I’m challenged to have fewer or zero sugar, limit coffee (just in the mornings, in small portions), avoid processed foods, and stick to a planned and intentional diet.

As mentioned earlier, I’m currently in my last semester of my Computer Science degree, with just a few courses and my thesis left to complete before graduation. It has been a great journey, and it deserves a happy ending. For this, I’ve set the task of getting my thesis published and achieving the highest grade in the thesis course. After graduation, I may pursue an academic career—I’ve been accepted into the master’s program at the University of São Paulo, and I’m also applying to UNICAMP and, with some effort, to universities in the USA. If I don’t follow an academic path, I’ll focus on getting a job and growing in it, learning and delivering value to the company while also absorbing as much as I can.

In terms of personal development, I want to improve my communication skills and enhance my self-organization. These are probably my biggest areas for improvement, so they must be addressed and left in the past. Additionally, other personal projects include improving my website, writing frequently on my blog, building a portfolio, and developing projects for it.

In finances, my objective is to create an emergency fund (covering six months of my expenses) and establish reliable, structured financial organization. This will likely happen later in the year, as I’m still an intern and don’t have a substantial income yet. Until then, I aim to learn as much as I can about personal finance, investing, and financial management.

Regarding my family, I deeply desire to get closer to them, visit more often, track my sister through her first year of high school, and perhaps organize a family trip. These are fundamental goals for me, and I will invest extra energy into them, as maintaining a close relationship with my family is essential to me, and I want to bridge the geographical distance with my best efforts.

It’s not my intention to make this longer, but I have some other goals that will be listed below along with the others in the text. Some of these will remain private, as this represents the limit of the transparency I’m building.
